# macsetup

There are many approaches out there for how to get a clean macOS install ready for use. This is mine.

You're welcome to fork it and tailor it for your needs. If you have changes that you feel will be beneficial to me or other users, please feel free to submit a pull request.

## Configuration

Please see the [example config](example.conf) and customize it for your needs.

Please add to or delete from [bootstrap.sh](bootstrap.sh), as appropriate, to have it do what you need to do to setup your Mac.

## Use

```
bash ./bootstrap.sh <config file>
```
